# Lab 3: Communicate something with Haply

## Finding the words

Sri and I decided that the most efficient way to tackle this lab would be to start with a quick brainstorming session. We created a virtual bulletin board and started thinking up juicy [ten dollar words](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ten-dollar_word#English). After thinking of a few, we grouped them into categories of related words.

We both thought the "toxic" and "sense of direction (negative)" categories felt the most promising haptically, so we decided to dive into some of those words to see what we came up with.

We ended up focusing on "misleading," "arrogant," "lethargic," and "spiky."

### "misleading"

For "misleading," we thought it would feel jarring to have a wall disappear out from under you and reappear again.
