# Lab 3: Communicate something with Haply


*Note: I worked on this lab with Sri!*

## Finding the words

Sri and I decided that the most efficient way to tackle this lab would be to start with a quick brainstorming session. We created a virtual bulletin board and started thinking up juicy [ten dollar words](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ten-dollar_word#English). After thinking of a few, we grouped them into categories of related words.

We both thought the "toxic" and "sense of direction (negative)" categories felt the most promising haptically, so we decided to dive into some of those words to see what we came up with.

We ended up focusing on "misleading," "arrogant," "lethargic," and "spiky," as they were the words that we immediately had ideas for.

## Playing with haptics

### "misleading"

For "misleading," we thought it would feel jarring to have a wall disappear out from under you and reappear again. Originally, we made the entire wall effectively disappear by creating one `FBox` and using the `setSensor()` method, but because the method does not work instantaneously 

### "arrogant"

### "lethargic"

{% include figure image_path="/assets/lab3/lethargic.gif" alt="lethargic." caption="_What we thought 'lethargic' feels like._" %}

### "spiky"

{% include figure image_path="/assets/lab3/spiky.gif" alt="spiky." caption="_'Spiky' ended up a struggle for us._" %}

Our vision for "spiky" was to populate the canvas with circles that would "pop" when the end effector touched them. However, we could not figure out a good way to get the popping sensation to feel right.
