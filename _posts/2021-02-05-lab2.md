# Lab 2: Intro to Haply

### [Home Improvisation](http://www.homeimprovisation.com/)

I enjoy both jazz and assembling Ikea furniture, so I had a blast [putting the Haply together](https://2diy.haply.co/). I could tell right away that the tool provided was not going to cut it torque-wise, but fortunately I was able to find the right size screwdriver (a weird star-shaped T6) in my partner's toolbox.

I had a small mishap where I accidentally stripped the screw holes of the pieces keeping the right arm of the Haply together, but my partner had the great idea of using a screw of the same diameter as the holes in the Haply arm as a quick fix. It works well enough for now but the nut does have a tendency to come loose, so I may need to brainstorm a more permanent fix later.

### "Hello Wall!"

Onto my least favorite part: getting the software working. The instructions on the official Haply website were minimal, so I got stuck a few times in my attempts to get the basic "Hello Wall!" program working.

#### Problem 1: What board is this anyway?

My first problem was figuring out what board to select as I set up the Arduino program. The board on the Haply said "Haply M0", but after some trial and error (and asking [Sri](https://sites.google.com/view/sricanhaplab/lab-2) for help) I figured out the correct board to select: “Arduino Zero (Native USB Port).”

#### Problem 2: I flashed the Haply, but I'm not feeling any feedback?

My second problem was a strange one: after loading the most basic Processing program (and blasting through a small roadblock where I realized I had to explicitly state in the code which port to use) I still wasn't receiving any haptic feedback.

Like every good scientist, I panicked upon such unexpected results and swiftly took to the Discord channel.

Despite being plugged into both the computer and a wall outlet, the Haply refused to produce any haptic feedback until I also plugged my laptop into a wall outlet. 

Finally: success!

### Creating a haptic maze loader

I admit, I may have gone a bit overboard when creating my maze.
